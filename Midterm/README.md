This midterm contains a moving wheel as well as a slideshow of three images.
Personally, I had to use Firefox and its texture changes in order
to see it render properly. The png file midterm_working.png shows that 
it does work. Additionally, these files use files in the "Common" directory.

Sincerely,
Grant Dunford
